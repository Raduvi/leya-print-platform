Here are some examples of "How To" for a few features of Leya.

<h4>How to upload templates in Leya </h4>

To upload a new template in Leya a .tgz file is required, we offer from the start in the templates samples folder a few possible templates that can be modified.
In the solution templates, go to terminal and run the following commands:

npm run build
npm pack

After the commands have ran sucessfully a .tgz file should be created.
Using the Designer solution drag and drop the .tgz file with a new template after re-build the rest app and the template will appear in the UI as a deployed template.
